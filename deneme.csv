barackobama,let’s get to work
barackobama,i know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting but watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful and if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful sustained and effective action this can be the moment when real change starts

barackobama,5 the more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away
barackobama,4 so if we want to bring about real change the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both we have to mobilize to raise awareness and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform
barackobama,3 to do that we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact changing the federal government is important but the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels
barackobama,2 the point of protest is to raise public awareness to put a spotlight on injustice and to make the powers that be uncomfortable but eventually we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices
barackobama,1 the protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system we should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support

ematack,sorry you feel that way but i am a good person &amp am extremely compassionate about others i wouldn’t be involved in something that i thought was cruel &amp pointless it’s all carefully created &amp the aim is to help guide the couples to make the right decision for the relationship
ematack,you’ve misjudged the programme far too quickly i cared very much about the people involved and the aim was to try and let these people see that you can survive by yourself as a single person and find confidence again that was maybe lost in the relationship
ematack,you are making a fool of yourself my interview with jesy was about people like you targeting people online to say nasty things to them nothing to do with a dating reality show that i’ve hosted with care and love towards the people i worked with
